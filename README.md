# Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Object Classification with Data Augmentation

This project aims to develop an object classification model that leverages type-2 fuzzy logic and data augmentation techniques to achieve higher accuracy and better handling of uncertainties in the data. The combination of fuzzy logic and data augmentation can lead to improved classification results in scenarios where traditional approaches may fall short.
